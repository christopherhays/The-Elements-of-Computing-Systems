This was an exercise that I completed from the book 'The Elements of Computing Systems'
The exercise was to write a program to interpret their specific brand of assembly language instructions and output them as binary instructions.
The format for the instructions and how the resulting binary works are all previous exercises.
I used python here because I hadn't used it before.
This program takes a command line argument and also creates a new file.
It has passed the a comparison test with their pre-made binary instruction file.
I'm adding readme files to learn git from the command line, which I think I prefer.

Feels like I'm talking to myself haha.
